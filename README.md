# Parkinson's Disease Classification

This project implements a machine learning pipeline to classify Parkinson's disease using the `parkinsons.data` dataset. It includes data exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and model interpretability.

## Key Features:
- Data Exploration & Preprocessing
- Multiple Classification Models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, etc.)
- Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report)
- SVM Model Deployment with Pickle
- Model Interpretability using SHAP
